//This class is incomplete and only gives us an example of how to declare a Filed.
// A filed is a internal state.
// unlike a normal variable a filed is declared inside the class not ina methode.
// the class filed declaration is a similar of that a primitive type.
// this version nly declare a filed (state) and does not have any behavior (instance method)
// An object that contains state, but no behavior, is sometimes called a record or struct.
// an object state is filed and an object behavior is method.
